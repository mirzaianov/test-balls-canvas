![MasterHead](./head.png)

## Description

### A test project that renders a set of balls on a canvas

### Features

- No third-part libraries for physics are used.
- A rectangular canvas field is initially filled with a random set of balls of a different size and color.
- The user can push a ball if he/she holds the left button of a mouse and touches the ball.
- The pushed ball elastically collides with the other balls on the canvas and with the borders of the canvas losing its velocity.
- The user can change a color of the ball with a context menu if he/she right-clicks a mouse on this ball.
